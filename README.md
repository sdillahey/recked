# Recked
## A Social Platform for your Travel Recommendations

Still a work in progress, Recked is planned to be a three-level tool for planning your next trip. To start, it provides search capabilities where you can narrow down on potential destinations based on a number of criteria. 


Once you select a city, Recked will display a list of socially curated travel recommendations that pertain to that particular city. Based on your experience, you can up vote and down vote the recks and create your own.

The last feature, which is still in the icebox, is to make your own ReckLists by adding other recommendations. Here you will be able to see a map representation, through the GoogleMaps API, of your selected locations, displayed by type.
